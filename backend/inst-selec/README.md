## tree-match-burs1 (C++)

Toy algorithm implementation.  
Performs same operations than `tree-match-graphs`, but uses a BURS approach instead. (Bottum Up Rewrite System).  
Naive BURS implementation, no table optimizations.  
Generate aa64-like or x64-like code. (x64-like doesn't work).  
Enginneer a Compiler book.  
BURS papers

## tree-match-graphs (C++)

Toy algorithm implementation.  
Basic tree patern matching, extension of naive version for digraph and multiple blocks.  
Generate aa64-like or x64-like code. (x64-like doesn't work).  
Enginneer a Compiler book.

## tree-match-naive (C++)

Toy algorithm implementation.  
Basic tree patern matching, only works on function with a single basic block and a single computation tree.  
Generate aa64-like or x64-like code.  
Enginneer a Compiler book
